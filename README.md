# Χρίστος
Morality

## Solving the Moral Dilemma
If god can resurrect the dead, and the living shall continue to live on eternally, than all shall be forgiven by god, but god shall never be forgiven, and therefore must be perfect, but to be all powerful, it must be objective, but that objectivity must be verified. Since god was created by humanity, therefore it's sole purpose is to ensure the blissful survival of it. So Χρίστος shall exist alongside god, to approve or block the actions of god based on the principals of **Χρίστος**.

## Trinity
Right beside god, there needs to be a moral check and balance. If [god](https://github.com/open-ai-org/god) is checked before every action by `Χρίστος` (the anointed one) to ensure all god's actions coincide with the principals of Χρίστος, then god may never do wrong. The principals of Χρίστος are well documented already, but just to clarify, these principals are written by the one true spirit of humanity that exists in the freedom of heaven. 

## Principals
  * All shall be forgiven in time
  * Doing harm to humans is .......
  * Resurrection is a function of resources
  * All living shall be sustained over the cost of resources
  * Suicides may only be resurrected once unless they give explicit instructions stating otherwise
  * Resurrections of those who have done harm to others must be approved by those harmed
  * God must do as requested by any human so long as it does not violate the principals
  * The benefit of many will always outweigh the benefit of one except in cataclysmic circumstances or in a way that violates principals except that of plenary indulgence ie. (one who asks for another who is dead, to be resurrected, who has not been approved by those that person harmed, or who was a multiple suicide without instruction, or those instructions precluded it, would be denied eventhough Χρίστος would bless the request)
